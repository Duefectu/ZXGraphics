# ZX Graphics Editor by DuefectuCorp

![ZX Graphics ](documentation/example.png)

Tool for edit GDUs and Fonts for ZX Spectrum 48K/128K. With this editor you can create custom UDGs and fonts.

The editor can handle files with the following extensions:

- `.udg`: (User Defined Graphics) It's an array of 168 bytes (21 characters x 8 lines each one) with the raw definition of this UDGs.
- `.gdu`: From the spanish "Graficos Definidos por el Usuario", it's the same than `.udg` 
- `.fnt`: Personalized font. And array of 768 bytes (96 characters x 8 lines each one) width the raw definition of the alternate charset.

In addition to allowing editing of these file types, data can be exported in `.tap` format for loading from an emulator (thanks to the export routine that has been developed by Hash6iron) or `.bas`, a format specifically designed for use in ZX Boriel Basic.

We are working on expanding functionalities and we would like to hear your opinion.

## How to start
Create a new empty file with the extenson .gdu, .udg or .fnt in the VSCode file explorer and open it.
